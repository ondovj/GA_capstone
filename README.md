## Problem Statement

(hopefully)

The food industry is an extremely competitive business. In order for companies to keep up with each other, there is constant research being performed on competitors' products. This type of research often times means working with products that have little to no branding or identifying information. Fortunately, the USDA maintains a database of over 250,000 branded food products currently on the market. This project will attempt to use a combination of nutrient information and ingredients (evaluated with natural language processing) on a selection of these products to create a predictive model that can classify the manufacturer of unknown foods for these reserach purposes.

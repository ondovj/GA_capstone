## Problem Statement

(hopefully)
Performing unsupervised learning on the USDA database of brande dfood products in the US. This exploration will find ### FIGURE OUT SPECIFIC GOAL ### certain types of relationships between foods, their ingredients, nutrients, and manufacturers.



### old statements

The food industry is an extremely competitive business. In order for companies to keep up with each other, there is constant research being performed on competitors' products. This type of research often times means working with products that have little to no branding or identifying information, and could be produced by a secondary manufacturer on contract. Fortunately, the USDA maintains a database of over 250,000 branded food products currently on the market. This project will attempt to use a combination of nutrient information and ingredients (evaluated with natural language processing) on a selection of these products to create a predictive model that can classify the manufacturer of unknown foods for these research purposes.

ALSO/OR something about consumers beign able to use this to determine who made a specific food. People are becoming more invested in the supply chain of their foods, and have concerns with certain sourcing or practices related to growing/processing/manufacturing. At the same time, With so many food companies being owned by other entitites, it can be difficult to tell what company a specific food came from. This project attempt to create a classification model that uses a combination of product nutrient information, and product ingredients (evaluated with natural language processing) that can predict the manufcaturer of a given food.
